{
  "remediation_success": true,
  "confidence": "high",
  "health_score": 85
}
Example Agent Usage: "Verify S1 recovery", "Check if Payment Gateway is healthy"

Installation
Prerequisites
Langflow installed and running

AIRS backend service available

Setup
Clone this repository into your Langflow components directory:

bash
cd langflow/components
git clone <repository-url> AIRS
Restart Langflow to load the components

The components will appear in the "Custom Components" section of Langflow

Usage Guide
Step 1: Configure Backend URL
For each AIRS component:

Drag the component to your flow

In the right sidebar, set the Backend API URL to your AIRS backend

Development: http://localhost:5000

Production: http://your-airs-backend:5000

Step 2: Connect Agent
Connect your AI agent to the tool inputs:

query, service_input, remediation_command, etc.

Step 3: Build Your Flow
Create workflows by connecting components:

Backend API Requirements
Required Endpoints
Your AIRS backend must implement these exact endpoints:

Service Management
GET /api/services - List all services

json
[
  {
    "id": "S1",
    "name": "Payment Gateway",
    "status": "healthy|warning|critical",
    "remediationInProgress": false,
    "awaitingRemediation": false
  }
]
Health Metrics
GET /api/services/{id}/metrics - Service health metrics

json
{
  "id": "S1",
  "name": "Payment Gateway",
  "status": "critical",
  "metrics": {
    "cpu": 85.5,
    "memory": 92.1,
    "latency": 450,
    "error_rate": 8.2
  }
}
Log Analysis
GET /api/services/{id}/logs/analysis - Log analysis

json
{
  "root_cause": "high_cpu_load",
  "patterns": ["CPU spikes during peak hours"],
  "suggested_actions": ["restart_service", "scale_instances"],
  "recent_errors": ["OutOfMemoryError", "CPUThresholdExceeded"]
}
Remediation
POST /api/services/{id}/remediate - Execute remediation

json
{
  "action": "restart_service",
  "reason": "AI-initiated remediation"
}
Valid Backend URL Examples
http://localhost:5000 ‚úÖ

http://airs-backend.internal:5000 ‚úÖ

https://api.airs.example.com ‚úÖ

Invalid URL Examples
http://google.com ‚ùå (wrong API structure)

http://localhost:5000/v2 ‚ùå (wrong endpoint path)

http://user:pass@localhost:5000 ‚ùå (credentials in URL)

http://localhost:5000?token=abc ‚ùå (query parameters)

Security Features
URL Validation
All components include robust URL validation:

‚úÖ Scheme validation (http/https only)

‚úÖ Hostname presence check

‚úÖ Credential prevention

‚úÖ Query/fragment prevention

‚úÖ Port range validation

Error Message Sanitization

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Cannot connect to AIRS backend service"
Verify your backend URL is correct

Check if the AIRS backend is running

Ensure network connectivity between Langflow and backend

"Service not found"
Verify the service ID exists in your backend

Check service mapping in component documentation

"Invalid backend URL"
Ensure URL starts with http:// or https://

Remove any query parameters or fragments

Don't include credentials in the URL

Debug Mode
For detailed debugging, check Langflow logs for component execution details.

Development
Component Structure
Each component follows this pattern:

python
class ComponentName(Component):
    inputs = [
        MessageTextInput(name="backend_url", ...),  # UI setting
        MessageTextInput(name="agent_input", tool_mode=True, ...)  # Agent control
    ]
    
    def _validate_backend_url(self, url):
        # Security validation
    
    def _make_api_call(self, endpoint):
        # Secure API communication
Adding New Components
Follow the existing security patterns

Include URL validation

Sanitize all error messages

Use consistent JSON response formats

Support
Issues: Create a GitHub issue with detailed description

Backend Integration: Ensure your backend matches the API contract

Agent Training: Provide clear natural language examples to your AI agent
